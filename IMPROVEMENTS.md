# Improvements log

Each round audits the codebase, makes 2-4 targeted improvements, verifies them, and records what changed here. Every claim below was checked by running the code; anything not verified says so.

## Round 1: symlink escape, truncated-read grounding, streaming robustness

Branch `improve/round-1`, stacked on `reliability-layer` (athish-shubhan/CodeSage#1).

### 1. Symlinks could read and index files outside the repo (security)

**Found:** the indexed repository is untrusted (ADR 0006), but `chunking.iter_source_files` read any file whose *name* had a text extension, and `context_expand.expand`/`read_file` checked containment with `os.path.normpath`, which does not resolve symlinks. Reproduced with a repo containing `leak.md -> ../outside/secret.txt` and `linkdir -> ../outside`: ingest scanned `leak.md`, and `get_file("leak.md")`, `get_file("linkdir/secret.txt")` and `expand_context("leak.md", ...)` all returned the secret.

**Changed:** `iter_source_files` skips files whose real path is outside the repo; `expand`/`read_file` go through a new `resolve_inside(root, rel)` that resolves symlinks on both sides before the containment check. Links that stay inside the repo, and a repo root that is itself a symlink, still work.

**Verified:** 3 new retrieval-service tests and 1 new integration test (ingest over real gRPC, then `search`, `get_file`, `expand_context`); the integration test fails with the fix reverted and passes with it.
